# AngularJS Arabic Keyboard

This is a simple arabic keyboard built using AngularJS. This keyboard is meant to be used on desktop only.

## Feature list
* Transliterate typing (type directly with you latin keyboard and this app will automatically transliterate it to arabic text)
* Change transliteration scheme. I have made 3 transliteration scheme so far, you could add more of it or create your own transliteration map. Just fork it, copy any transliteration json file and edit it yourself. I'd be glad to merge it here :)
* Change font family and font size
* Copy arabic text
* Translate (direct translation link to google translate)
* Search (direct search link to google)
* Image (direct image search link to google images)
* any more suggestion?
